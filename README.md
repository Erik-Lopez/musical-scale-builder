# Scale generator

This little program lets you input a note and a mode and returns a scale. The scale can be written with flats or sharps and the notes can be in English "A B C D..." as well as Spanish "Do Re Mi Fa...".

*Warning: Old garbage code. It gets the job done but it's painful to read it.*
